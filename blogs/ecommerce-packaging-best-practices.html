                                <li><strong>Bubble Wrap:</strong> Excellent for fragile items, electronics, and glassware</li>

                                <p>While bubble wrap costs more per unit than paper, it often provides better protection-to-cost ratio for fragile items, reducing return and replacement costs by up to 40%.</p>
