Smart packaging strategies can significantly reduce expenses without compromising product safety or customer satisfaction.</p>

                            <h2>Understanding Total Packaging Costs</h2>
                            <p>True packaging cost optimization requires looking beyond material prices to understand the total cost of ownership.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Damage and Returns:</strong> Poor packaging leading to product damage</li>

                                <li><strong>Labor Costs:</strong> Time spent on packaging operations</li>
                                <li><strong>Shipping Penalties:</strong> Oversized packages and dimensional weight charges</li>
